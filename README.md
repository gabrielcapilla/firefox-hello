## Browse without distractions

Tabs in Laconic make less noise, giving more room to browse the web letting you see what’s important to prevent you from getting distracted.

## Keyboard Centered Design

See quick definitions and answers. Jump to any site quickly. Here you can read about the shortcuts.

## Fast and efficient

One file without surprises. Only 3.6KiB, as simple as you always wanted.

## Protect your privacy

Works on top of Firefox, and [uBlock Origin works best on Firefox](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox). Stops ads and trackers, so you can browse faster without being tracked. And when you’re using a slow or expensive internet connection, it lets you block scripts and images, so pages load faster and use less data.

## FAQ

Where did you get your inspiration from?
Inspired by Min Browser. I wanted to bring the Min Browser experience closer to Firefox. Min is written entirely with CSS and JavaScript using Electron, and is open-source software, available on GitHub.

Do you use KDE?
Add to your about:config the following parameters:
`widget.use-xdg-desktop-portal.file-picker` `1`
`widget.use-xdg-desktop-portal.mime-handler` `1`

In about:config you can make the bottom window corners rounded by setting `widget.gtk.rounded-bottom-corners.enabled` to `true`.
